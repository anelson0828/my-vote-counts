  title: Why This Election MATTERS
  description: >-
    The 2020 American Presidential Election is undoubtedly the most important
    election in modern history. The Republican Party are making voter
    suppression and misinformation a major part of their election campaign this
    year. While Joe may not have been your first choice for this election, it’s
    vital that we back his campaign in order to kick Trump out of office. The
    polls have Joe firmly ahead, but as we saw in 2016, that means nothing if
    our votes are not counted. 


    With Joe ahead in the polls, the number 1 most important thing you can do in this election is make sure that you and the people around you turn out to cast your vote for Joe, and make sure it’s counted. The best way to do this is create a voting plan to make sure your voice isn’t stolen by dirty tricks, talk with 10 people in your life to make sure they’ve done the same - then ask them to reach out to 10 of their friends.


    That’s it. One plan, ten conversations, and you’re officially an election rockstar!


    How to get started? Easy - first thing is to create your own voting plan to guarantee your vote will be counted. 
description: With many states changing polling locations, mail-in or absentee
  voting requirements, voter ID laws, conducting voter roll purges etc, your
  regular voting process is likely to have changed from previous elections. Make
  sure you don’t “wing-it”, and spend 5 minutes making a solid plan to make sure
  your voice isn’t stolen this November.

      text: Make a list of 10 people you know you think are planning to vote for
        Biden, or could be easily persuaded. You don’t need to speak with rusted
        on Trump supporters - Biden is ahead in the polls, so this is about
        making sure our fellow supporters actually get out and vote. Write this
        list down, whether it’s on a piece of paper or a document on your
        computer. Leave plenty of space beneath each name to write notes.
      title: Make a list
    - image: /img/coffee-gear.png
      text: Start as early as possible. It takes time for some issues to marinate, so
        don’t leave this until the day before election day - reach out as soon
        as you can - if they’re busy, ask them if they have time for a 15 minute
        conversation on a certain day and set an appointment
      title: Contact now
    - image: /img/tutorials.png
      text: Come prepared for each person - everyone has different policies and issues
        that are important to them, so keep that person’s priority in-mind
      title: Come prepared
    - image: /img/meeting-space.png
      text: Your conversation must be personal and come directly from you. Phone call
        or face to face is best, but texting is ok too. Do not just post
        randomly on your timeline, invest the time on a one-on-one conversation.
        Consider the person you’re reaching and do their preferred form of
        communication. Make small talk and discuss their thoughts on the
        election first. Don’t come straight in and ask them to take action, but
        show that you are listening to their thoughts and feelings.
      title: Make it personal
    - text: >
        Explain the importance of everyone taking action on this election
        (hopefully they agree), and tell them you have a very simple and easy
        way for them to contribute without having to donate or cold-call
        strangers. Clearly outline the points raised above and what you want
        them to do, don’t beat around the bush. Explain that this is important
        to you, and that they would not only be helping their nation but doing
        you a personal favour. 
      title: Call to action
    - text: Build the plan with them right then, on the spot. If they’re not in front
        of a computer or comfortable with it, make it yourself (prepare yourself
        beforehand) while talking with them and print or email it for them once
        you’re done.
      title: Do it together
    - text: Make sure to thank them in a sincere way, and re-iterate the impact their
        actions are having on the future of our nation. Tell them how much their
        action means to you personally.
      title: Show appreciation
    - title: Pass it along
      text: Ask them if they’d be comfortable reaching out to ten of their friends to
        do what you just did with them.
    - text: If they’re eager and ready to go - great! Get them to write down the ten
        names and when and your person will contact them together, on the spot.
        If they need some time to think or don’t seem as interested - that’s
        fine. Give them some time, and check in later to see if they’re ready.
      title: Give them time
    - text: "These ten people are now under your wing, so it’s your job to make sure
        they stick to their plan and have contacted their ten people (if they
        agreed). Be appreciative every time and again link your personal
        feelings for what they have done. "
      title: Follow-up
  heading: "Key aspects of Relational Organizing:"
  description: >
    We’re going to do something called relational organizing, so please do the
    following. You might be uncomfortable, but consider the following:


    People WANT to help - you are not pestering them, but giving them an opportunity to feel in control and that they are making a difference. Everybody feels helpless, and this is THE MOST important thing you can do. Letting them know that by doing this one thing they can rest easy knowing they made a serious contribution is giving them peace of mind. 


    This is a confusing election to vote in, with miscommunication and last minute changes happening all the time. Even if you know your contact is a reliable democrat, they still may not have their vote counted due to administrative errors. Having a plan beforehand will ensure their vote counts.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
