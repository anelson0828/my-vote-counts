  title: Why This Election MATTERS
  description: >-
    The 2020 American Presidential Election is undoubtedly the most important
    election in modern history. The Republican Party are making voter
    suppression and misinformation a major part of their election campaign this
    year. While Joe may not have been your first choice for this election, it’s
    vital that we back his campaign in order to kick Trump out of office. The
    polls have Joe firmly ahead, but as we saw in 2016, that means nothing if
    our votes are not counted. 


    With Joe ahead in the polls, the number 1 most important thing you can do in this election is make sure that you and the people around you turn out to cast your vote for Joe, and make sure it’s counted. The best way to do this is create a voting plan to make sure your voice isn’t stolen by dirty tricks, talk with 10 people in your life to make sure they’ve done the same - then ask them to reach out to 10 of their friends.


    That’s it. One plan, ten conversations, and you’re officially an election rockstar!


    How to get started? Easy - first thing is to create your own voting plan to guarantee your vote will be counted. 
description: With many states changing polling locations, mail-in or absentee
  voting requirements, voter ID laws, conducting voter roll purges etc, your
  regular voting process is likely to have changed from previous elections. Make
  sure you don’t “wing-it”, and spend 5 minutes making a solid plan to make sure
  your voice isn’t stolen this November.

      text: Make a list - Make a list of 10 people you know you think are planning to
        vote for Biden, or could be easily persuaded. You don’t need to speak
        with rusted on Trump supporters - Biden is ahead in the polls, so this
        is about making sure our fellow supporters actually get out and vote.
        Write this list down, whether it’s on a piece of paper or a document on
        your computer. Leave plenty of space beneath each name to write notes.

  heading: "Key aspects of Relational Organizing:"
  description: >
    We’re going to do something called relational organizing, so please do the
    following. You might be uncomfortable, but consider the following:


    People WANT to help - you are not pestering them, but giving them an opportunity to feel in control and that they are making a difference. Everybody feels helpless, and this is THE MOST important thing you can do. Letting them know that by doing this one thing they can rest easy knowing they made a serious contribution is giving them peace of mind. 


    This is a confusing election to vote in, with miscommunication and last minute changes happening all the time. Even if you know your contact is a reliable democrat, they still may not have their vote counted due to administrative errors. Having a plan beforehand will ensure their vote counts.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
