  title: Why This Election MATTERS
  description: >
    This is a confusing election to vote in, with miscommunication and last
    minute changes happening all the time. Even if you know your contact is a
    reliable democrat, they still may not have their vote counted due to
    administrative errors. Having a plan beforehand will ensure their vote
    counts.

  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
